Here in Munich, Germany, Felix is excited to go to a traditional _Weihnachtsmarkt_, a holiday market! He keeps texting photos to his friend Anna about all the fun things he's doing: drinking hot mulled _Gl√ºhwein_, going ice skating, shopping for presents.
But Anna can't find her glasses, and can't clearly see what's in the pictures!

For today's challenge, Anna needs a service that, given an image, describe the image and gives some keywords about what it contains.
